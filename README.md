# SILI Game: Space Invaders Lite 05 (MODS)
Developed a Pokemon-themed game in my second semester while pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. The game is inspired and styled after the classic arcade game, Space Invaders, which involves shooting projectiles at opponents while simultaneously avoiding their projectiles.  In addition to meeting the basic requirements for the class project (SILI-version05), I further developed the game to implement additional features and modifications (mirrored drawing effects).  The project integrates object oriented concepts (polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance) as well as techniques (dynamic memory allocation) to ensure that the game runs seamlessly.  Utilized a graphics library (developed by Katie Dektar) in order to create the images, colors, and application of listeners (animation, mouse events).

something about running only in linux, or cs50 sandbox, dont mess with the game width, height parameters because the elements have static values to them and will look wonky if widths and heights are changed
